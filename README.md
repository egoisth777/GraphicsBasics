# GraphicsBasics
This repository is the rewritten of the fundamental computer graphics concept of CIS4600 course threads. Each individual assignment is rewritten to maximize the robustness and stability. Each function and class follows rigorously the Google c++ naming convention, and that of the Clean Coder to formalize the whole project structure.
